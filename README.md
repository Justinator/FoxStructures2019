# :open_file_folder: Basic File Structure

## :page_with_curl: Pages

Each individual page is titled page - page title ex. about = page-about.php

## :dancer: Styles

Do not make style changes in the css directory. The styles for the website are all in the \_scss directory. Each individual page has had its own style sheet setup for styles unique to that page, and then there are sheets setup for general styling like the footer or typography. The \_variables.scss sheet has site wide variables that can be used in your scss sheets.

## \_scss folder

### Variables

Variables folder contains our sites variables, mostly color variables for styles throughout the sites

### Breakpoints

This file contains my breakpoints for mobile styling

### Layout

Contains all the styles used for layouts, columns, images, text blocks etc...

### Header

Styling for the sites header/navigation

### Footer

Styling for the sites Footer

### Typography

Typography settings for headers paragraphs etc ...

### Buttons

This theme has three registered menus. Main menu for the primary navigation, footer menu for the footer menu and mobile menu, for customizing separate menus for each of these locations if needed.

To edit the main navigation use the header.php file

## :house: Homepage

The homepage uses the front-page.php file

### Editing the services blocks on the homepage

The services blocks can be found in the inc folder, inside the file services-overview.php. This file contains the entire section, holding images, descriptions and links to each service page

### Featured Homepage Projects

The homepage featured projects section can be found in featuredHomepageProjects.php. This again holds all images, titles and links for the entire section.

```html
<div class="featuredProjectWrapper">
  <a href="/portfolio/the-oaks-golf-course/">
    <div class="featuredProjectOverlay"></div>
    <div class="featuredProjectContent">
      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/OaksIntExtStillsMediumSquare.jpg" class="featuredProjectImage" alt="The Oaks Golf Course Club House in Cottage Grove, WI. Designed and built by Fox Structures">
      <h5 class="featuredProjectTitle"><span class="projectTitleSpan">The Oaks Golf Course</span></h5>
    </div>
  </a>
</div>
```

To add a new featured project simply switch your URL to your new featured project URL, change your cover image and your title and upload.

### Editing the CTA

At the time of this build we were promoting Fox Structures careers and trying to drive viewers to this page. To update this CTA section navigate to the inc folder and find the file CTA.php

## :cow2: About

### The leadership display  

The leadership team section can be found in the inc folder, titled leadership.php.

```html
<a href="/leadership/mark-mashlan/">
  <div class="leaderWrap">
    <div class="imageWrapper">
      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fox_EmployeeMarkMedium.jpg" class="image" alt="Headshot of Fox Structures President Mark Mashlan">
      <div class="leaderImageOverlay"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="leaderInfo centerText">
      <h5 class="employeeName"><span class="primaryText">Mark Mashlan</span></h5>
      <div class="centerUnderline"></div>
      <h6>President</h6>
    </div>
  </div>
</a>
```

Add or remove your team member as needed. Each individual team member has their own page, where their headshot and bio are displayed. These pages just use the default template.

## :hammer: Adding projects to the portfolio

I know this may have not been the most elegant way of setting this up but, I don't like using WordPress plugins like contentViews for things like displaying content. I set
things up this way to have full control of styles and usage. I also wanted full control of the order that projects are displayed. Since so many of them have very little to no detail,
I didn't want to bury the good projects like the old site did. Projects are displayed exactly the way you set them, so if you have a great new project to add, add it in the featured projects
section at the top and then move the project you're replacing to the first spot of the main portfolio section so it's easy for site visitors to see.

Featured projects use the template file Featured Case Study Projects. The projects that have little to no detail just use the default template. To create a
new project page duplicate the oaks golf club page for a good base and start adding in your new info and project images.

### Add your new project to the portfolio.

Projects are stored in the inc folder. inc>projects>projectType

1. Navigate to the folder for the project type that you're creating.
2. In your text editor duplicate one of the existing projects and rename it with whatever your new project is titled. The project file will look like the following:

```html  
<a href="/portfolio/forest-brook-farms/" class="column agricultural">
  <div class="featuredImageWrap">
    <div class="imageWrapper">
      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/forestBrookFarmsExteriorSmallMedium.jpg" class="image">
      <?php get_template_part("/inc/portfolio-overlay"); ?>
    </div>
    <div class="projectInfo">
      <h5 class="employeeName"><span class="primaryText">Forest Brook Farms</span></h5>
    </div>
  </div>
</a>
```
3. Change the project url to the new page that you created for this project.
4. Make sure your project has the proper class ex. commercial projects will be classed "column commercial". The class titles are used for the gallery filter so make sure those are accurate
5. Change your projects featured image. To prevent the image issues the old site had I've been using 600x400 images sizes for all projects so the gallery remains consistent. The old images
were all different sizes and created an uneven and scattered gallery display
6. In the projectInfo div change your projects Title
7. Open the portfolio page file page-portfolio.php and add your new template part to the portfolio.
8. Upload and enjoy your new project

## :construction: Adding a new job posting to the careers page

1. Add your new career page to the site
2. Enter your job details and add a featured image to the page. This will be the hero image for the job post
3. Careers pages use the careers-single.php page template. This loads our sidebar and all components for the page.
4. To update the sidebar navigate to the inc folder and find careers-sidebar.php.
5. Add a new list item and upload  

## Services Pages

Each services page has itâ€™s own single page file. To edit the services sub-nav/sidebar navigate to the inc folder and find services-sidebar.php.

## :newspaper: News Posts  

The news page uses the single.php template file and all archive page files/components can be found in the template-parts folder.

### Adding a blog post  

Nothing fancy here. Simply add a blog post just like you would any standard WordPress site. Add a featured image, add your author and change to the News category.

Hopefully that covers anything that you will need to update with this site.
